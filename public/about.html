<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm an aspiring web developer who aims to get better and better non-stop</p>

<p>I started my journey on 11.11.2025 and I want to be able to create basic websites at the end of that month with using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

<p>After reaching my first goal, I will be working on React to progress. Basically, I will never stop improving and developing.</p>
